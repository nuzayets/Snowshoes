Snowshoes

Snowshoes is a framework for writing bots for D3 using D3Advanced (D3Advanced.com). 
It is modular and thread-safe and provides convenience functions for many common tasks. 
The basic unit of execution in Snowshoes is a Sherpa. This is basically a thread that
completes common tasks - the main sherpa should contain the linear path for the bot to
follow, and others do helpful tasks like monitor the main sherpa for hangups/delays, 
track your gold and check if you have died.

The most important thing to remember is that any calls to the D3 API must happen
on the game thread, and to facilitate that there are many functions that will perform
some task on the game thread. These should be kept as light as possible so as to not
stall the client and force a disconnect.

Snowshoes provides a basic GUI with an output console and some Play/Pause/Stop buttons. 
At the moment Pause does the same thing as Stop. Sorry 'bout that.

I chose the name Snowshoes because they help you through a Blizzard :)

Enjoy.
